# MCP Usage Rules for CAP projects

- Always use `cds-mcp search_model` to find entities, fields, services (including HTTP endpoints).
- Always use `cds-mcp search_docs` when modifying CDS models or using CAP APIs.
- Do not grep .cds files directly unless cds-mcp returns no results.
- Always cite tool output when giving recommendations.
