# people-lite (CAP + cds-mcp demo)

Minimal **CAP project** designed to demonstrate how to use [`@cap-js/mcp-server`](https://github.com/cap-js/mcp-server).  
It contains only **two entities** and **one action**:

- `City`  
- `Person` (with `city` association and `isContact` flag)  
- `markAsContact(person: UUID)` â†’ sets a person as contact

## ðŸ¤– AGENTS.md

This repo also includes AGENTS.md with MCP usage rules.
It ensures AI coding agents (Copilot/Claude/Cline, etc.) always use cds-mcp tools instead of raw file grepping
